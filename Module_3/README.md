# Objective

In this module, we are going to experience some possible analysis using a data package called [BrPoliCorpus](https://github.com/rll307/BrPoliCorpus). Please note:

- BrPoliCorpus is still under construction and some inconsistencies might be.
    - We will probably need to deal with them as possible.
- The corpus is not complete, it is under expansion. 
    - So please, do not mind if it is reorganised.

## What are we going to do?

We are going to analyse this corpus in many ways:

1. Comparing different ideological groups.
1. Comparing different time frames.
1. Analysing the difference between texts. 
1. Plotting and representing results.

## Network

For network analysis, we will need the following software:

- [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) (Bastian et al. 2009) (a software for network analysis)
