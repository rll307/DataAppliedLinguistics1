## Introduction

**GitHub** is a tool for hosting code and collaborating. It allows us to create repositories so we can upload our code for the community and share it. Here we are using a free version of **GitHub** for education.

Here is a [general tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on the platform, which is nice to read. We will be mostly posting our code and sharing it with our friends. Please note that:

* If you have any doubts regarding an exercise, please post an issue in your repository directory, I will be happy to help.
* Please, always take my code as an example for starting coding yourself
* We will be posting our codes on Google Classroom timeline.

GitHub offers a student/teacher package. [Here](https://education.github.com/students) is some more information.
