# Basic Notions

Here we are going to discuss some basic notions of R, mostly in order to understand some basic syntax and the IDEs.

- *.R files are R scripts, you can run them in your IDE

Note that in each file there is an assignment that must be completed.

The `Python` discussion will take place when we start using it.
