In this course, I am going to discuss some strategies of text analysis and data analysis. It is part of my CNPq-funded project and seeks to make corpus tools, `R`, and some small `Python` accessible to researchers in Applied Linguistics and other social sciences. 

This is the ongoing venture, so you are welcome to help in the codes and tutorial improvement. If you see any mistake or possibility of code rewriting, please let me know. Research collaboration is also very welcome, so drop me a line. 

## What it is going to cover

This course covers some tools for corpus and discourse analysis using **R**'s language and packages, and some data scraping and text processing using **Python**.  It is not intended to be a very advanced set of tutorials. 

### Modules

These modules are under construction, so some themes or tutorials might change during this semester. But in a nutshell, it intends to cover:

1. Tools:
     * This set of tutorials brings the tools needed for my class on its online version.
1. First steps:
     * Basic lessons for understanding `R` and its integration with GUIs;
     * Basic lessons for understanding `Python` and its integration with GUIs.
1. Data analysis projects:
     * Some hands-on projects on linguistic data analysis, including:
        * Data organisation and processing;
        * Data scraping from websites and social media.

### Assignments

In the assignment section, there will be a set of tasks to be performed. There is at least one task for each module; in some cases, there might be more.

# Please note that

- It is not a progressive set of tutorials. It starts on the basics, but then it becomes problem-oriented. 
    - Sometimes basic and more intermediate elements of code are bought together. 
- Some packages will need to be installed during the analysis. 
    - So make sure you have the appropriate system permission.
- The course is mostly directed to language data, but other areas might benefit from it. 
- If taking the course **LP226-A - TÃ³picos em Linguagens e Tecnologias II**, the assignments are mandatory.
